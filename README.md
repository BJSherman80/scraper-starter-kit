# Web Scraper Starter Kit

## Set Up

- Clone this repo down

- Visit `localhost:3001` in your browser

## Build a Scraper

- Step 1: What data do you want? Determine which site and on a very granular level, which pieces of data.
- Step 2: Figure out how to hook into the element(s) you need. Try to access in Dev Tools console.
- Step 3: Make a plan for how you will clean your data. You may want to play around with this in the Dev Tools console before going into Step 4.
- Step 4: Update your scraper function in `index.js` to use what you learned in Steps 2-3. Visit the appropriate URI in the browser, see what happens.
- Step 5: Refine anything you'd like until your endpoint is returning the JSON you want it to!
